# ASP.NET Core MVC Calculator App

This project is a simple calculator web application built from scratch using ASP.NET Core MVC and C#. It demonstrates the journey from setting up a .NET development environment in Visual Studio Code to building and running a working MVC web app.

## What It Does

- Provides a web interface to add or subtract two numbers.
- Uses MVC architecture:  
  - **Model:** (optional, for future enhancements)  
  - **View:** User-friendly web forms for input and result display  
  - **Controller:** Handles calculation logic and form submissions
- Demonstrates clean code, best practices, and job-ready coding techniques[2].

## How It Was Built

- Set up .NET SDK and Visual Studio Code as the development environment[3].
- Used the `dotnet` CLI to scaffold a new MVC project.
- Implemented a custom controller and view for calculator functionality.
- Used Git and GitHub for version control and sharing the project.
